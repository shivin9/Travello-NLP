2nd June- tried to extract a pattern in text by applying the fourier transform on length of paragraph. Can't get any clear and definite patterns. Need to use higher dimentional vectors with more features.

3rd June- ideas:
1. use classifiers like ANN for headings extraction and train on websites whose structure is well known eg. ladyironchef
2. capture a place heading with an address in between

Going to implement the address identifier which uses the UN database... 

6th June:-
Implemented the address identifier using UN database but it's not working properly... fixing it today. FIXED
