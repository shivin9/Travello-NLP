# Travello-NLP
This automation API is used by the Travello-extension to automate the extraction of names, addresses, write-up and the image-url of points of interest on a webpage.
It is used as follows:-

1) Create a parameters dictionary as follows:-

            paramsold = {'BATCH_SIZE': 512,
                'GRAD_CLIP': 100,
                'LEARNING_RATE': 0.01,
                'NAME': 'RNN',
                'NUM_CLUST': 3,
                'NUM_EPOCHS': 20,
                'NUM_FEATURES': 8,
                'N_HIDDEN': 512,
                'SEQ_LENGTH': 1,
                'TYPE': '1st classifier'}

2) Initialize the model using the parameters defined above.

            rnnModelold = getModel(paramsold, "rnnmodel-old")

3) Retrieve the addresses using the following method:-

            addresses = getAddress(url, [(paramsold, rnnModelold)])

4) Retrieve all the titles as follows:-
            
            url = 'https://sf.eater.com/maps/10-top-spots-for-indian-in-san-francisco/gajalee'
            titles = getTitle(url, addresses)

5) Retrieve all the images as follows:-

            images = getImg(url)

6) Finally consolidate all the pieces of information to create a blob
   of information using the following command:-

           finalThing = consolidateStuff(url, titles, addresses, images)

It should look something like this:-

```
