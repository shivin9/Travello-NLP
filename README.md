# Travello-NLP
This automation API is used by the Travello-extension to automate the extraction of names, addresses, write-up and the image-url of points of interest on a webpage.
It is used as follows:-

1) Create a parameters dictionary as follows:-

            paramsold = {'BATCH_SIZE': 512,
                'GRAD_CLIP': 100,
                'LEARNING_RATE': 0.01,
                'NAME': 'RNN',
                'NUM_CLUST': 3,
                'NUM_EPOCHS': 20,
                'NUM_FEATURES': 8,
                'N_HIDDEN': 512,
                'SEQ_LENGTH': 1,
                'TYPE': '1st classifier'}

2) Initialize the model using the parameters defined above.

            rnnModelold = getModel(paramsold, "rnnmodel-old")

3) Retrieve the addresses using the following method:-

            addresses = getAddress(url, [(paramsold, rnnModelold)])

4) Retrieve all the titles as follows:-

            titles = getTitle(url, addresses)

5) Retrieve all the images as follows:-

            images = getImg(url)

6) Finally consolidate all the pieces of information to create a blob
   of information using the following command:-

           finalThing = consolidateStuff(url, titles, addresses, images)

It should look something like this:-

{
    "1": {
        "Write-up": "This Mission spot has a coastal seafood twist, setting it far apart from other Indian in the area. Look out for the fish malvani masala, thali and curry leaf calamari, and wash it all down with a rose lassi.",
        "Image URL": "https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/38785334/gajalee.0.jpg",
        "Place Name": "1 Gajalee",
        "Address": [
            "525 Valencia St San Francisco, CA 94110",
            "(415) 552-9000"
        ]
    },
    "2": {
        "Write-up": "Prized for its ample servings of affordable vegetarian fare, Udupi Palace has developed a following of loyal dosa lovers. This South Indian spot specializes in delicious dosas, but there's also a full complement of uthappam and other classics like aloo mutter and biryani.",
        "Image URL": "https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/38785336/udupi.0.jpg",
        "Place Name": "2 Udupi Palace",
        "Address": [
            "1007 Valencia St San Francisco, CA 94110",
            "(415) 970-8000"
        ]
    }
}

# So, How does it actually work?
The web is filled with reviews of travel spots, dining places, historical sites etc. in form of structured, professional resources like **[TripAdvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.in/)** or **[MakeMyTrip](https://www.makemytrip.com/)** and unstructured resources (mostly blogs) like **[LadyIronChef](http://www.ladyironchef.com/)** or **[Boston Eater](https://boston.eater.com/)**. Making an application which can mine relevant, structured information from all these varieties of places is surely a challenge but in this project we have managed to acheive a decent performance in terms of precision, recall and versitality.

## Mining data from structured resources.
This was pretty easy to say the least. One has to just mine the html page and look for specific, named tags which store the required information. eg. on TripAdvisor all the headings are in the `<span>` tag while addresses are nicely encapsulated in the `<street-address>`, `<locality>` and the `<country-name>` tags.

## Mining data from blogs
This was the really challenging part of the project which took the major time of my internship. There are two major problems which prohibit us from employing a generic solution by seeing the html structure of the webpage:-

* People use different blogging services to create their blogs which makes sure that every blog is a different website altogether with different ways of storing data usually blog posts

* Every blog writer has a different style of writing and arranging their page which makes the task of our information scraper even more difficult. Also, unlike professional websites like **TripAdvisor**, blogs are usually simple and everything is written in form of plain text

These factors motivated me give up on html-page mining approach and I turned to machine learning for help. The only hope of success of such a solution lied in the fact that even though the html-pages of blogs are unique, every blog post follows a loosely similar structure ie. every post has a **Main Title** eg. 10 best restaurants in Singapore followed by details of 10 restaurants which are themselves structured having a **Title**, **Text body**, **Photo** and **Address**.

So I tried to capture any one of these parameters and then mine the other three as they lie nearby only. Title names can be
