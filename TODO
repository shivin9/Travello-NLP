Fine tune the neural network... it's returning nonsense also right now
Try HMM and Structures Perceptron :- fails...

try to apply another filter over the output of the Neural Network remove further nonsense.

ML learning techniques will used in conjunction with the hard-coded filters as they also perform well enough

Standardize the data... Also complexity can be added
Instead... dataset needs to be improved. Need more variety
