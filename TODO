Fine tune the neural network... it's returning nonsense also right now
Try HMM and Structures Perceptron :- fails...

try to apply another filter over the output of the Neural Network remove further nonsense.

ML learning techniques will used in conjunction with the hard-coded filters as they also perform well enough

Standardize the data... Also complexity can be added
Instead... dataset needs to be improved. Need more variety. It needs to be made more singapore sensitive

Sequencing feature is still not coming...

parallelize the image extractor... very slow
train the RNN and the CNN using rolling data... it makes more sense to do it that way for both
