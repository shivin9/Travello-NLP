2nd June- tried to extract a pattern in text by applying the fourier transform on length of paragraph. Can't get any clear and definite patterns. Need to use higher dimentional vectors with more features.

3rd June- ideas:
1. use classifiers like ANN for headings extraction and train on websites whose structure is well known eg. ladyironchef
2. capture a place heading with an address in between

Going to implement the address identifier which uses the UN database... IMPLEMENTED

6th June:-
Implemented the address identifier using UN database but it's not working properly... fixing it today. FIXED
Idea: Instead of manual parameters in the address identification mechanism, use machine learning to fix the optimum parameters

7th June:- Planning to implement the machine learning module for learning the structure of an address based on the keywords and structure of the text.
collected and cleaned the dataset for training

8th June:- further enhancing the dataset and then going to train using differentmodels
Need to have not only the address but also along with it random text above and below to emulate the real world data

9th June:- researching techniques for image extraction... can use pinterest attributes in images

10th June:- written script for image extraction... images are extracted based on size and attached to place names ie. headers using document similarity methods
