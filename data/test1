If you are keen to experience the local way of life by dining at such unique and old-school restaurants, drop by Sing Heung Yuen – one of Hong Kong’s very last few Dai Pai Dongs.

The humble Chinese alfresco eatery has been around for nearly half a century and is especially well-loved amongst locals for its signature tomato egg noodles and tasty condensed milk buns.

Dai Pai Dongs refer to Hong Kong’s open-air roadside food vendors that sell economical dishes. These outdoor street stalls are an important part of Hong Kong’s culture and history.

However, the future of these local eateries is bleak. According to Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, there are only 25 existing Dai Pai Dongs left today.

Dai Pai Dong essentially means an eatery with a huge license plate. These restaurant licenses were issued to both disabled veterans and relatives of deceased civil servants after World War II.

Following congestion and hygiene problems, the government stopped issuing these licenses and it was only in recent years that children can inherit them.

Sing Heung Yuen was formerly on Elgin Street, but has relocated to its current venue at Mee Lun Street some thirty years ago. The no-frills Dai Pai Dong is jam-packed throughout the day with both locals and foodie travellers who are intrigued by the novelty of dining at one of Hong Kong’s last few authentic Dai Pai Dongs.

Look around and you will probably notice that everyone is eating the iconic bowl of noodles dunked in thick tomato broth. Yes, this is what you should be at Sing Heung Yuen for.

Every bowl is customisable, and prices start from HK$18. You can actually choose from instant noodles, macaroni or rice noodles, as well as add-ons such as bacon, sausage, egg, ham, luncheon meat and mixed vegetables etc.
