Rest assured that everything was done to make sure that the burgers you have in Singapore will be the exact replica of what you can get in New York.

Although the official Singapore menu and prices are not released yet, it has been said that prices will be kept lower than the average prices of regular gourmet burgers, around the S$15 mark.

The opening of Burger Joint could mean big competition for many other burger restaurants in Singapore and we are all the more excited for even better burgers to hit our island.
