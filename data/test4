Do you own a pet? Then you would have experienced the problem of having to leave them at home while you head out for a meal. Many times, it bugs us because we wish they could be there to bask in the moment with us, whether if it is in a cafe for a meal or just there to idle the afternoon away.

Thankfully, more cafes these days appreciate the presence of these cuties and have agreed on dedicating some of their outdoor seating to accommodate all who are keen on stringing their pets along. A number of pet cafes have also been on a rise where you can dine indoors with them while indulging in some playtime with the other pets present.

Here are 14 Pet-friendly Restaurants and Cafes in Singapore that you can bring your fur kids to.
