Brasserie Saint James
Patricia Chang
Tipsters, readers, friends and family of Eater usually all have the same question: Where should I eat right now? Restaurant obsessives want to know what's new, what's hot, which favorite chef just launched a sophomore effort, where to sip the cocktail of the moment. And while the Eater 38 is a crucial resource covering old standbys and neighborhood essentials across the city, it is not a chronicle of the 'it' places of the moment. Thus, we offer the Eater Heatmap, which will change continually to highlight where the foodie crowds are flocking at the moment — even if that might be an older spot.

Check out the map of the Bay Area's hottest restaurants right now below (ordered alphabetically), and drop any feedback in the comments section.

1 Brasserie Saint James
Taking over the former Abbott's Cellar space, this spinoff of popular Reno restaurant Saint James Infirmary has taken over the beer-focused torch. It's a brewery and restaurant, featuring a seven-barrel brewhouse that produces 12-14 beers, and a menu of Southern-influenced dishes like gumbo and dirty rice, and the "Buenos Aires Barbecue," featuring a mixed grill for 2-4 people.

2 Cadence
The long-awaited restaurant from chef Joey Elenterio (Chez TJ, Wayfare Tavern) and restaurateur Jay Bordeleau has landed like an oaisis in a gritty section of mid-Market. Elenterio's two-sided tasting menu (one vegetarian, one for meat-eaters) mixes nicely with a crafty cocktail menu. Pass through a hallway into the adjoining bar, Mr. Tipple's Recording Studio for jazz and more boozy times.

3 Cala
Gabriela Cámara is a culinary star in Mexico City, and she's bringing some of that shine to Mid-Market with the seafood-focused Cala. Pretty people are flocking to the pretty space where they can munch on light fare like ceviches, trout tostada and mussels tamale while sipping on tons of mezcal and tequila. For a quick lunch fix, stop by Tacos Cala in the alley behind the restaurant for tacos made with in-house nixtamilized masa.

4 Del Popolo
The brick-and-mortar spot from popular pizza truck Del Popolo has arrived, with an expanded menu of Neapolitan-style pies and small plates. Now with wine, beer and an enormous wood-fired pizza oven, this 50-seat restaurant is already proving to be a hot spot in its Nob Hill hood.

5 jū-ni
Ju-ni means 12 in Japanese, and as such, the menu is 12 courses of omakase nigiri that changes seasonally and with the availability of fish, which is flown in twice a week from Tokyo. Chef Geoffrey Lee (Akiko's, Sushi-Ran) is leading the charge, offering only fresh fish and no fillers.

6 Leo's Oyster Bar
It's a lively, 50s era throwback to more civilized times, when diners drank Champagne with every meal. While that's something of an exaggeration, it's certainly an option at the stunner from Anna Weinberg and Big Night Restaurant Group (Marlowe, Park Tavern). Towers of seafood, bubbles and palm-bedecked wallpaper set the tone for a luxurious evening in the Financial District.

7 Little Gem
Little Gem is Hayes Valley's newest lunch addition, offering a counter-service menu of food that’s gluten-, dairy- and refined sugar-free. The brainchild of Eric Lilavois (former COO at the Thomas Keller Group) and chef Dave Cruz (Ad Hoc), Little Gem offers fresh soups, salads and wraps like the Tuscan Pork Shoulder with pickled carrots and cucumber on NON flatbread. And it's firing on all cylinders now that breakfast, lunch and dinner are on the docket every day from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m.

8 Mensho Tokyo
It's the first stateside expansion of Tokyo's cult favorite ramen shop from chef Tomaharu Shono. Expect long lines of ramen fanatics, who are waiting for bowls of ramen, tsukemen, mazesoba and special options from the chef, who uses ingredients like truffles and chocolate in some of his more adventurous creations.

9 Mister Jiu's
After years in the making, chef Brandon Jew's hotly anticipated Chinatown restaurant has opened, offering a five-course, banquet-style menu of contemporary Chinese food. The thoroughly modern space is in the old Four Seas restaurant, now a destination for family-style meals using premium ingredients. Sizzling rice soup, salt and pepper Monterey squid, and tea smoked duck are some of the options, accompanied by cocktails from Danny Louie.

10 Petit Crenn
Dominique Crenn's casual sophomore effort is a big leap from her flagship, Atelier Crenn. The concept is based on Crenn's dream dinner party, where for $79, you get fed a daily-changing, five-course, family-style dinner of seafood and vegetables, like whole trout roasted over a wood-fired grill with cider sabayon and cabbage with charred scallions. The wine list is focused on natural French wines, rosé and champagne, and the space is all-white and very minimalist.

11 The Company at MINA Test Kitchen
The third concept from the ever-changing Mina Test Kitchen is Indian food, and like those before it, it doesn't disappoint. The passion project of Mina Group wine director Rajat Parr and chef Vikrant Bhasin, the tasting menu (choice of 7, 9, or 11 courses) is a flavorful journey of dishes like spiced crab salad, and Kashmiri kofta. A selection of gin-based cocktails and carefully chosen wines is on hand to complement the bold flavors.

12 The Perennial
It's sustainable from start to finish, but the idea is to provide food that tastes even better than saving the earth feels. The new mid-Market restaurant from Karen Leibowitz and Anthony Myint (both of Mission Chinese Food) opened in January, serving "eco-friendly comfort food" like potato confit with clam bagna cauda and celeriac gnocchi.

French-Scandinavian fare is the focus of this shiny new addition to SoMa. More than a lunch option for Westfield shoppers, Volta has a majorly stylish vibe, as well as a menu featuring house-pickled herring, boeuf bourguignon and and köttbullar, swedish beef and pork meatballs with potato puree and lingonberries. There's also a large selection of aquavit, wine and beer.

14 Waxman's
Berkeley native Jonathan Waxman is back in the Bay, in a big way. The roomy space in revitalized Ghirardelli Square is the new home of Waxman classics like JW chicken, and Bay Area influences like tagliatelli with Dungeness crab. The adjoining café is soon-to-open, and will offer a light-filled space for lunch or dinner.

16 Whitechapel
This new spot from Martin Cate (Smuggler's Cove) and John Park (Novela) is a gin-lover's fever dream, fashioned to look like an abandoned London Underground station and distillery. And matching up to the detailed interior is a lengthy list of gin-based cocktails, from long lost classic cocktails to modern-day concoctions. The food is Bangladeshi-inspired pub fare, like mussels vindaloo and pakoras with spicy lime pickle, Asian pear and lassi bubbles. Don't miss the splurge-worthy "haunch and flagon," a 36 oz. dry-aged tomahawk with Yorkshire pudding and "tankards of ale" for two ($95).

17 Wise Sons Bagel & Bakery
The highly anticipated bagel outpost from Wise Sons’ Evan Bloom and Leo Beckerman is now open in the Fillmore, offering fresh bagels, schmears and towering bagel sandwiches. While it’s tempting to draw a comparison between the beloved bagels of the East Coast and these West Coast cousins , the partners are just hoping to bring something delicious to the SF scene. Luckily for San Franciscans who love a good line, they’re already in high demand on weekend mornings.
