Take your pick, indulge in an eat-all-you-can style of feast.

If you’re an avid foodie like me, I suppose you’ll be able to relate to the sheer excitement I get from seeing rows and rows of sumptuous good eats lined up before your eyes.

For me, what I love most about buffets is not just the freedom I have to savour as much good food as I can, but also the moment of mindless and passionate indulgence in the selection of good food that befall my eyes. This is especially gratifying when the buffet spread belongs to one of my favourite cuisines of gourmet delight.

I believe that each of us has our preference for our favourite cuisine of good eats. So here’s a guide on some of the best buffets in Singapore, grouped according to the category of cuisine which the restaurant has to offer. I’m sure they’re all in to gratify your gourmet pleasure.

3. The Line (Shangri-La)

best buffet singapore The Line-seafood-2
Here at The Line, the dining area is furnished with a modern style of display. The menu offers a selection of stylish bites conjured by a team of creative chefs. I can say that the restaurant is constantly bustling with activity, throughout the day.

Featuring 16 theatrical kitchens, The Line showcases an array of culinary delights that reflects an extensive international cuisine. Diners are spoilt for choice, with the availability of Chinese delicacies, exquisite Japanese, hearty Western, healthy salads and savoury desserts.

Not forgetting the local dishes, which is what The Line is well-known for. Prepared with meticulous effort by chefs in-house, the buffet menu here is a vivid reflection of our local gourmet paradise.

4. Plaza Brasserie (PARKROYAL on Beach Rd)

A point makes the buffet menu at Plaza Brasserie an outstanding one, lies in the availability of choice of fish to be cooked in the Hong Kong style or Curry Fish Head style. Selections include garoupa, red snapper and sea bass.

Along with its ‘Crustacean Corner’ live cooking station, diners again, have a wide selection of seafood. These include the soft-shell clams (lala), bamboo clams, mussels, prawns as well as mud crabs.

5. Lime (PARKROYAL on Pickering)

best buffet singapore Lime Parkroyal on Pickering-2
With much greenery around and designed based off agriculture, PARKROYAL on Pickering’s hotel-in-a-garden concept is looking to turn some heads. Lime, the hotel’s signature open-kitchen all-day dining restaurant serves up an extensive spread of Asian flavours and contemporary international favourites in a lively theatrical mood.

lime parkroyal-06301017
On top of being an international buffet restaurant, what sets Lime apart from other buffet restaurants is its Peranakan kitchen. Hearty grandma’s cooking conjured with quality ingredients, Lime calls for a must-visit.

The seafood spread at Lime is also awesome. I very much love the fresh oysters and the prawns. Not forgetting also their special matcha chocolate fondue which was a splendid blend ratio of matcha and chocolate content.

Melt — The World Cafe indeed lives up to the reputation of its name. Featuring a multi-cultural culinary feast with an open kitchen concept, dining at this restaurant is an amazing experience. Diners get to watch the chefs at work, as they conjure a huge variety of cuisines.

The ‘Asian Kitchen’ section of presents ‘Noodles of the Day’ as one of its theme, where which chefs prepare different Asian-based signature mains such as prawn noodles, Laksa and Lor Mee. The Lor Mee whet up by our hotel chefs here at Melt is pretty good, and reflects a local flavour close to our hearts.

North Indian cuisine at Melt-2
Another point of highlight is the North Indian cuisine section at Melt. A large array of rich and appetising curries are available, on a rotational basis, with all the spices and curries made in-house by the chefs at Melt.

The Indian dishes offered here are of quality flavour and taste, compared this particular cuisine offered at other buffet restaurants. Hence if you are a fan of curries, naans and pratas, Melt is a suggested place for you to indulge in as-much-as-you-can eat platters of these treats.

7. Shin Minori Japanese Restaurant

Featuring an Ala-Carte Buffet Menu, Shin Minori upkeeps the freshness of the variety of sashimi it has on its menu. These premium cuts are both thick and juicy, and are a good value for a reasonable price paid.

8. Ikoi

Ikoi Japanese Restaurant-25-best-buffets

Located at the Lobby of Hotel Mirama – one of the hotels alongside the row of nondescript business-like buildings is Ikoi Japanese Restaurant. I must say that this is a hidden gem within the Robertson area.

This quaint Japanese restaurant is marvellous in terms of its food and service quality. Be it sashimi, sushi, maki, tempura, grilled dishes, rice or noodles, I felt that each of them were genuine reflections of the Japanese cuisine.

Very reasonable buffet pricing also, a restaurant that deserves another trip back.

Expected Damage: $38++ per pax

Ikoi Japanese Restaurant: 401 Havelock Rd, Hotel Miramar, #01-01, Singapore 169631 | Tel: +65 68873788

Shabu Sai-Ultimate Buffet Guide
Credit
Another very value-for-money option here, Shabu Sai presents plates and plates of quality cuts of meat from all over the world, for just a nominal price to be dunked in their delicious shabu shabu soups.

Shabu Sai is an excellent choice to go for the carnivorous Singaporean. Despite all the meats, lets not forget the buffet of vegetables available as well. Free flow of soft drinks and ice cream are also available at the desserts bar for an additional $1.99++. The downside is that there is a time limit of 70 mins for lunch, and 90 mins for dinner so do take note.

Expected Damage: Weekday lunch $14.99++; Weekday dinner $24.99++ | Weekend lunch $19.99++; Weekend dinner $24.99++

Address: 181 Orchard Road, Orchard Central, #08-09/10/11, Singapore 238896 | Tel: +65 68846760 | Facebook

10. Kushi Dining Bar

best buffet singapore Kushi Japanese Dining Bar
Kushi Dining Bar is a spectacular gem hidden well right into the outskirts of Orchard Road. Over at Hotel Royal, I feel Kushi serves up premium, quality Japanese dishes at just a fraction of the price as per its non-buffet competitors.

Expect to indulge in decadent and all the more delicious selection of their cooked food; wagyu beef cubes, lobster porridge, salmon head, tataki and many more. Their sashimi is really fresh and juicy as well, featuring premium thick cuts of salmon belly, swordfish, tuna, tako, amaebi and more. If you are looking for a high quality Japanese buffet, Kushi is the place to be at.

Address: 526 MacPherson Rd, Singapore 368216 | Tel: +65 62856525 | Website

11. Shin Yuu

Shin Yuu best buffet singapore
For a Japanese buffet, Shin Yuu carries uniquely crafted sushis that are of a higher grade than its usual competitors, with the likes of seared tuna belly sushi, and their signature Shin Yuu Special Aburi Sushi (Salmon); seared salmon sushi with a smear of mentaiko. You also get complimentary Toro Sashimi, Taraba Kani, Zuwa Kani Tempura and Japanese Ice Cream with every a la carte buffet dinner order.

The aburi was something refreshingly different and we really enjoyed how the different textures and taste complimented the torched flavour really well. Sashimi fans will also be delighted to hear that they offer premium, thick cuts, fresh and juicy to appeal to everyone.

Expected Damage: Lunch $36.90++ per pax | Dinner $49.90++ per pax

Ssikkek-2
Ssikkek is a meat-lover’s heaven come on earth. There is so much meat available in its buffet spread. The buffet is extremely popular at just $24++ per adult.

The Tanjong Pagar outlet tends to have long queues and reservations are recommended; else check out the Novena outlet which is also equally as hard to walk-in. Eating time is limited to 2 hours per table though when you place a booking.

wang dae bak-
After having visited a few Korean barbecue restaurants within the vicinity of Tanjong Pagar and Amoy Street, I must say that Wang Dae Bak has one of the best ambience and quality of service for Korean barbecue restaurants in Singapore.

best buffet singapore wong dae bak
Despite not having a wide variety of choices on its bbq menu, I must mention that Wang Dae Bak indeed serves high quality meat. Coupled with the magic of charcoal barbecue, the barbecued meats conjured in this restaurant are exquisitely fragrant.

Sakura-pouring bucket ingredients
Part of the Suki Group of Restaurants, Sakura International Buffet is a halal Japanese restaurant that has recently incorporated its new idea of having the “Seafood in a Bucket” into its buffet menu.

This makes the restaurant stand out as the only eatery that offers this pre-existing dining concept as part of a buffet, and this is only exclusive to Sakura’s revamped outlet at Clementi Woods. A newfound gem for seafood aficionados like myself.
