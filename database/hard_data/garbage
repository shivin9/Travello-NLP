A hidden secret trailer parked just east of the interstate, serving more traditional taco fare. Great for a late-night taco craving after fun on Dirty or East 6th.

We always return for the classic Kouign Amann and Croissants, which have been dubbed as one of the bests in Singapore. There is also a dine-in area at TBB outlets where you can relax with a gourmet sandwich and a coffee.

#1 ARTISAN BOULANGERIE CO.

PAUL is one of the biggest chains in France, and its outlets in Singapore are extremely popular too. Besides the must-try croissant which we swear by, the eclairs and palmier are to die for.

Both an art gallery and a cafe, Artistry is a dual-concept cafe that allows you to bring your pet along. They have a relatively large alfresco sitting where you can have a nice cool drink while your pet rests.

Definitely worth making a special detour if you are visiting Bali soon!,Even the author of Eating For Beauty David Wolfe is a huge advocate of this beautiful cafe. The design might be a major draw, but we visited Clear Caf primarily for its irresistible dishes. The ingredients used are sourced locally from the Island of Gods itself and the dishes are cooked in 100% pure coconut oil.

Foursquare,Share this place,3 Amber India,This spacious upscale Indian restaurant is a touchstone for downtown eating, and their weekday lunch buffet has a line wrapped around the restaurant. Follow everyone's lead and opt for the buffet, which offers the best bang for your buck with its extensive spread of Indian dishes.

This food truck has finally found a permanent brick and mortar, but their irreverent takes on Indian street food remain unchanged. Try their signature tikka masala burrito or opt for the decadent sexy fries topped with cheese, onions and pork belly. Just don't forget to grab a napkin

Noori Pakistani & Indian Cuisine,Tandoori chicken is a specialty at Noori, where you can expect classic Indian dishes like korma and curries. Things can get spicy, so don't push past your boundaries unless you're ready for the real deal

Kasa Indian Eatery,This casual spot features quick counter service and a clean, streamlined interior, and Kasa's focus on local and natural ingredients and proximity to Dolores Park makes it a foodie favorite

Little Delhi,This low-key spot has a fan base of diners who can't stay away from the tikka masala, tandoori and fluffy garlic nan, and large portions and reasonable prices keep 'em coming back for more

May 25, 2016, 4:11p,Swift & Sons,Eric Kleinberg,Good burgers are aplenty in Chicago and you don't have to wander very far to find one, but which are the hottest of the hot? The following 15 are the latest spots offering mouth-watering burgers or have recently added new, juicy creations to their menu. It's tough to pick favorites in such a crowded field so let's just agree that the real winners in the intensifying burger wars are the eaters.,1 3 Greens Market,River North received a definite upgrade in the lunch department earlier this year with the opening of 3 Greens Market. The new concept offers a collection of Hogsalt Hospitalitys greatest hits, including items from Green Street Smoked Meats, Doughnut Vault, Small Cheval and more. With wait times at Au Cheval these days reaching several hours, more opportunities to grab one of those famous burgers are always welcome.

Share this place,4 Cindy's,The Chicago Athletic Associations popular rooftop spot is best known for its great cocktails, large shareable plates and sweeping views of Millennium Park. But drop in on a weekday for lunch and enjoy different options like a lamb burger with piquillo pepper jam, goat cheese and charred eggplant. Just dont blame us if you dont make it back to work afterwards.,Cindy's,12 S Michigan Ave Chicago

Share this place,7 Johnny's Grill,Sarah Jordan took over the Logan Square greasy spoon last summer and spruced things up. The menu now offers cheffy items like artisan toasts and housemade pop tarts, but staples like a double cheeseburger still remain. The griddled creation smashes two patties together and layers it with sharp cheddar, Dijonnaise and a sizable helping of sweet pickles for a burger thats a cut above the usual diner offerings.,

Share this place,8 MAD Social,Those who frequent the United Center for events know the food and drink options on Madison Street are limited. Fortunately, Stefani Restaurants latest concept is a welcome addition that features globally-inspired fare. Stop in for drinks before a game and chow on the aptly-named Mad Burgera monstrous sandwich made of ground wagyu beef, Chihuahua cheese, pork belly, Cajun onion strings, house pickles, baby arugula and mayo.

Share this place,9 Maple & Ash,The Gold Coast steakhouse pulls no punches, offering luxury and decadence fit for royalty. The restaurants downstairs section, though, is a more casual affair with its own food menu so diners can relax over a burger. Its piled with cheddar, pickles, red onion and Dijonnaise. Bacon and fried egg are optional additions, but you might as well go big because there are no wrong choices here.,Fab Food Chicago

Share this place,10 Oyster Bah,Lettuce Entertain Yous seafood shack isnt the most obvious spot in the city to grab a burger, but its a good option nonetheless. If youre not in the mood for a lobster roll, try Uncle Orkies Onion Burger. Like the name suggests, onion lovers will be in heaven as two brisket and short rib-blend patties are slathered with a good helping of caramelized onions, cheese and mayonnaise.

Bistro du Midi,For more than five years, this Provenal bistro has been the perfect place to dazzle out-of-towners, thanks to doting service, world-class wines, a plush but unfussy dining room, and prime Public Garden frontage. From-the-land proteinssuch as seared duck breast accompanied by sweet potato, artichoke, and duck jusare stellar, though the real draw is the seafood dishes (inventive crudo, inky tagliatelle with squid and uni) from executive chef and Le Bernardin alum Robert Sisca.

Brewers Fork,The line between good eating and better imbibing is, thankfully, blurring, and no place better exemplifies that ambiguity than John Paine and Michael Cooneys Charlestown joint. Here you can pair a barrel-aged blonde with crisp maple-glazed pork belly or mussels bathed in a beer-and-tasso-ham brotheach churned out of an impressive 700-degree Le Panyol wood-burning oven. Or sip on a tulip glass brimming with Berliner Weisse, a perfect complement to one of Paines pillowy, char-blistered pizzas(the sweet butter-and-sugar corn with salty nduja still haunts our dreams). Not a fan of the suds? How about a bottle of bubbly from the Languedoc, or some funky Normandy cider to savor alongside an expertly prepared tuna crudo? In todays quaffing climate, you can have it all. Man, are we spoiled.

Centre Street Caf,A Jamaica Plain fixture renowned for its Sunday brunch, Centre Street Caf has been transformed by the Tres Gatos team into the type of neighborhood spot that draws regulars every day of the week. The petite space is as comforting as cashmere, with service that is vigilant, never cloying. Not sure about that Greek xinomavro on the wine menu? You can sample a splash before committing to a half carafe. Pair it with excellent starters or a range of hand-rolled and extruded pastas from chef Brian Rae (who trained under Rialtos Jody Adams), all of which easily compete with the Ribelles and Giulias of the proverbial block. And about those Benedicts and Belgian waffles: With upgrades like house-made doughnuts, buttery drop biscuits, and a pancetta-and-peperonata breakfast sandwich, there are now even more reasons to join the weekend faithful winding down Centre Street

Island Creek Oyster Bar,Four years ago, Duxburys Island Creek Oysters, restaurateur Garrett Harker, and Lineage chef Jeremy Sewall collaborated to create this stunning reflection of coastal New Englandone that swiftly became an anchor of the dining scene. Tuck into elegant dishes like lobster-roe noodles with shreds of braised short rib in the dining room, or soak up the energy of the lounge, where youll have a front-row seat to both the shucking action and the production of the cocktails, perfectly designed to quench all fried-oyster-slider-induced thirst

Sukiyaki Beef Noodle Soup ($7.8),My very standard order of Sukiyaki Beef Noodle Soup ($7.8) looked very much the part after I topped it with wakame, spring onions, and tempura flakes. The noodles were fantastic, the thick, chewy strands slippery and satisfying. The soup was less amazing, a bit too sweet and lacking in depth, but it hit the spot in combination with the excellent noodles and passable beef.,Sukiyaki Beef Curry Noodle ($10.8),Chris Sukiyaki Beef Curry Noodle ($10.8) was distinctly less impressive. Despite the still-great noodles in the thick curry sauce, there was just nowhere enough, especially given what can no longer be considered a cheap price tag. I would definitely recommend paying an extra $2 for double the noodles that is, if you insist on ordering this.,Front To Back: Chikuwa Fish Cake ($1.5ea)/Pumpkin Tempura ($1.5ea)/Kaarage Fried Chicken ($1.5ea)
