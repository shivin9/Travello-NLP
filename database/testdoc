 Heston Blumenthal Dessert

If you want to get fat, go to London. The British city has cuisines from all over the world, and the sheer number of options is mind-boggling to say the least.

Meal times are never dull when in London, and we always look forward to the next meal because our list of places to check out never ends.

Getting this done was hard, because it is hard to point down to just one or two favourites. But here’s a Guide to 14 of Our Favourite Food Places in London; first-timers to London should visit all of these to have a fair glimpse of what London can offer!


Assa

#1 ASSA KOREAN RESTAURANT

Assa is our go-to Korean restaurant when in SoHo, London. The prices are relatively affordable (by London’s standard) and the Kimchi Pork Stew (£22) is the tastiest.

If you are with friends, or simply feeling extra hungry, go for their value-for-money set. For £35, you get a Korean stew with kimchi, rice cake, two bowls of rice and two drinks.

53 St Giles High St
London WC2H 8LH, United Kingdom
Daily: 12pm – 12am
Nearest Station: Tottenham Court Road

Big Easy Lobster

#2 BIG EASY

We found a lobster shack that can rival Burger and Lobster. At £20, you get a whole Maine lobster that is beautifully grilled, complete with fries and side salad. And it comes with a complimentary cocktail, too!

Not too sure if we were extremely lucky or what but on the several occasions we went, the lobsters were significantly huger than B&L’s, and the meat was a lot fresher. It is now a pit stop for us when in Covent Garden.

Big Easy

It has also one of the best kept-secrets in London. On every Monday, you can get UNLIMITED servings of a platter of North Carolina Chopped Pork, BBQ Chicken and St Louis Pork Ribs with Coleslaw, Beans and Fries for just £19.90. And it comes with a pint of beer too.

12 Maiden Ln
London WC2E 7NA, United Kingdom
Tel: +44 20 3728 4888
Mon to Wed: 12pm – 11.30pm
Thu to Sat: 12pm – 12.30am
Sun: 12pm – 11pm
Nearest Station: Leicester Square

Burger & Lobster Lobster Roll

#3 BURGER AND LOBSTER

This – the famous Burger and Lobster. Where do we even start?

The concept of Burger and Lobster is brilliant. There are only three items on the menu – burger, lobster and lobster roll – and at £20 each, they represent fantastic value.

Burger & Lobster

A whole fresh lobster grilled/ steamed (choose the steamed option), accompanied by a generous bowl of lemon butter dip, a side salad and a bucket of fries. All for only £20.

Burger and Lobster has the winning formula: a sexy crowd, sexier cocktails, unpretentious and fun atmosphere, and brilliant food at unbeatable price. As much as Burger and Lobster has become a place where every tourist would go to, it still remains as a must-visit dining destination in London.

6 Little Portland St
London W1W 7JE, United Kingdom
Tel: +44 20 7907 7760
Mon to Thu: 12pm – 10.30pm

Nearest Station: Oxford Circus

Heston Blumenthal Dinner

#4 DINNER BY HESTON BLUMENTAL

If you are a fan of Chef Heston Blumenthal – chef and owner of The Fat Duck – you definitely have to drop by Dinner by Heston Blumenthal at the swanky Mandarin Oriental, Hyde Park.

On a budget? Opt for lunch instead of dinner with the three-course sample menu – very reasonably priced at £36.

Dinner Heston Blumenthal

Dinner by Heston Blumental is a concept that banks on the comfort of ancient recipes. How the culinary team will surprise you is with its modern interpretations of these age-old traditional recipes, without steering away too far from its original ideas and tastes.

When you are at it, please do yourself the favour and order the Tipsy Cake. The famed dessert is reason enough for us to go back just for it.

66 Knightsbridge
London SW1X 7LA, United Kingdom
Tel: +44 20 7201 3833
Daily: 12pm – 2.30pm, 6.30pm – 10.30pm
Nearest Station: Knightsbridge

Dishoom Breakfast

#5 DISHOOM

It is no secret that Dishoom is our (and many others’) favourite Indian restaurant in London. Mystically sexy, Dishoom should be on everyone’s bucket list when visiting London. From its menu and price points to its decor and ambience, no other Indian restaurants come close.

Their menus differ during different times of the day, and while we love the classic lunch/ dinner menu, the breakfast is what we would get out of bed for. Be there as early as 8am to avoid long queues.

22 Kingly Street, London W1B 5QB
Tel: +44 20 7420 9322
Mon to Thu: 8am – 11pm
Fri: 9am – 12am
Sat: 9am – 12am
Sun: 9am – 11pm
Nearest Station: Oxford Circus

Duck and Waffle

#6 DUCK AND WAFFLE

Everyone visits Duck And Waffle for two things – the splendid view overlooking the city of London from the 40th floor of Heron Tower, and the signature dish – Duck and Waffles (£15 during breakfast, £17 all day) – which gave the restaurant its name.

Duck and Waffle opens 24/7, but reservations are still recommended anyway because they are perpetually booked.

Heron Tower, 110 Bishopsgate
London EC2N 4AY, United Kingdom
Tel: +44 20 3640 7310
Open 24 Hours
Nearest Station: Liverpool Street

Flat Iron Steak

#7 FLAT IRON

There is only one dish on the menu at Flat Iron restaurant – the Flat Iron steak. The steak may not be of the best cut but at £10 for a steak, it is considerably cheap and warrants a visit.

You can order accompanying sides such as dripping cooked fries, creamed spinach, and roast aubergine.

Flat Iron

Occasionally, they would offer special and better steak cuts at seasonal prices, as well as surprises such as burgers.

17 Beak St
London W1F 9RW, United Kingdom
Daily: 12pm – 11pm
Nearest Station: Piccadilly Circus

Lantana

#8 LANTANA

Lantana is an all-time favourite brunch spots in London, and it is arguably the best. There are three outlets in the city, but we like to patronise the one on Charlotte Street.

It is a casual Aussie-style café with very relaxing vibes that is perfect for brunch over hearty food, coffee and pastries. If you are there for breakfast, you must try the English Muffin Breakfast with sausage patty, fried egg and bacon. The chilli jam is to die for.

Lantana Breakfast

The Asian Duck Rice surprised us. The ingredients – duck, pancetta, cucumber and chilli jam – elevated this seemingly ordinary dish to something quite special, and to us Asians, nothing beats the comfort of a fried rice dish.

13 Charlotte Pl, Fitzrovia
London W1T 1SN, United Kingdom
Tel: +44 20 7637 3347
Mon to Fri: 8am – 6pm
Sat & Sun: 9am – 5pm
Nearest Station: Goodge Street

Kanada-ya Ramen

#9 KANADA-YA

We have tried numerous ramen shops in London, but sadly, most of them are catered to the Westerners’ palate and nothing near to how authentic Japanese ramen would taste like in Japan.

Kanada-ya

Kanada-ya is an exception. The tonkotsu ramen is exactly how a good pork broth ramen is supposed to be, with rich and flavourful broth, pork slices flavoured egg with a runny center, fungus and leek.

64 St Giles High St
London WC2H 8LE, United Kingdom
Tel: +44 20 7240 0232
Mon to Sat: 12pm – 3pm, 5pm – 10.30pm
Nearest Station: Tottenham Court Road

Maison Bertaux

#10 MAISON BERTAUX

One of the oldest patisseries in London is Maison Bertaux, our go-to place for a quiet afternoon tea in London. They offer many beautiful cakes and rustic pastries. Make sure you try their almond croissant.

Maison Bertaux

28 Greek St
London W1D 5DQ, United Kingdom
Tel: +44 20 7437 6007
Mon to Sat: 8.30am – 11pm
Sun: 9.30am – 8pm
Nearest Station: Leicester Square

New Fortune Cookie Duck

#11 NEW FORTUNE COOKIE

After trying several roast ducks in London, New Fortune Cookie won our hearts with the best roast duck in London. Better than our previous favourite, Gold Mine. And better than the famous Four Seasons.

And at £9.50 for half duck – as compared to £13 at Gold Mine and £13.50 at Four Seasons - it is the cheapest option. The staff here are friendlier, and we like how we do not feel pressured to leave. In case you have no idea, the staff at Four Seasons will always chase you out once they see that your plates are empty.

1 Queensway
London W2 4QJ, United Kingdom
Tel: +44 20 7727 7260
Daily: 12pm – 11pm
Nearest Station: Queensway

Patty & Bun

#12 PATTY AND BUN

We have said it before and we will say it again: Patty and Bun’s Smokey Robinson burger is hands down the best burger in London.

Smokey Robinson Burger

Messy, greasy and finger-licking good, the Smokey Robinson Burger (£8.50) comes with everything you need in a burger – caramelised onions, bacon, smokey mayo, cheese, tomato, lettuce, and a juicy beef patty.

Beyond the amazing burger, the mood at Patty & Bun is hippy and loud; you instantly feel cool just by dining there. It truly delivers a unique and complete burger experience.

22-23 Liverpool St
London EC2M 7PD, United Kingdom
Tel: +44 20 7621 1331
Mon & Tue: 11.30am – 10pm
Wed to Fri: 11.30am – 11pm
Sat & Sun: 11.30am – 9pm
Nearest Station: Liverpool Street

Prufrock

#13 PRUFROCK

Prufrock has achieved cult status in London and it is widely recognised as one of the best coffee shops in the city. The coffee here is rich, creamy and well-balanced; indeed, it is easily the best cup of coffee you can find in London.

There is a small selection of sweet and savoury baked goods to go along with your cuppa.

Prufrock London

Its flagship cafe on the bustling Leather Lane in Clerkenwell also offers coffee tastings, training and events.

23-25 Leather Ln

The Muffin Man Scones

#14 THE MUFFIN MAN

Have you heard? These are the best scones in London!

The Muffin Man is an old-school English tea shop in Kensington that serves a variety of breakfast dishes, rustic cakes and scones.

The Muffin Man

Come here for tea and get the legendary scones and you will be rewarded with crumbly, perfectly baked goodness. The Devon Cream Tea set (£6.50) comes with a pot of tea, two toasted scones with jam and Devon cream.

If this still ain’t a quintessential British experience, we don’t know what is.

12 Wrights Ln
London W8 6TA, United Kingdom
